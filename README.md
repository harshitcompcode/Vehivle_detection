# Vehicle Detection and Counting using YOLOv4 🚗

![Project Image](project_image.jpg)

## Overview 📋

This project utilizes YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, for vehicle detection and counting in images and videos. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it suitable for various applications, including traffic monitoring, parking management, and more.



Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x 🐍: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- YOLOv4 Weights 🏋️‍♂️: Download the YOLOv4 pre-trained weights (YOLOv4.weights) from the official YOLO website and place it in the `weights/` directory.
- OpenCV 📷: You will need OpenCV installed to work with images and videos. Install it using `pip` if you haven't already: `pip install opencv-python`.
- Other dependencies 📦: Install other project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Installation ⚙️

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/harshil-1402/vehicle-detection-yolov4.git](https://github.com/harshil-1402/Vehicle-Detection)https://github.com/harshil-1402/Vehicle-Detection
   cd vehicle-detection-yolov4
